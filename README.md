# image_search_deep_learning
<div>
  <div>The pototype of&nbsp; patent and e-commerce comondity image search.</div>
  <div>We use alexnet for feature extraction,with pretrain model on imagenet and finetune on our dateset</div>
  <div>Here is our finetune model https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eSaq2oa with 93% top-3 accuracy on validation set.</div>
 Â <div>We apply CUDA libreary-python-interface to accerate similarity computation,which allow us to retrieval in 0.2s for 300 thousand images at a single GPU <div>
